  I am a researcher focusing on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), User Experience (UX), and Human Factors.

  My research centers on communal user needs and Quality of Experience (QoE) across multiple technology domains. I am particularly interested in extracting and conceptualizing user needs from large-scale user-generated data (e.g., online reviews), and validating their effects on user experience using empirical methods.

  I also study human-centered AI and digital health, especially in contexts involving accessibility, technology-marginalized users, and health-support systems using LLMs and multimodal AI.
